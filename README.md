# UoB_BC_Weather_Dashboard

# Introduction
The idea was to create a weather dashboard that someone who travels a lot can search the name of a city and be displayed the current weather conditions (Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed & UVI. In addition to the name of the city, the date, and an icon giving information about conditions for the day) & a 5-day forecast (Temperature and Humidity. Ind addition to the date and an icon giving information giving information about the conditions for that day.

## Why did I do this?
To gain an understanding of what APIs are and how they can be used. In addition to that, it allowed me to use the knowledge of jQuery and javascript up until that point.

### What I learnt
I would say i learnt a fair bit about AJAX and how it is implemented into applications to retrieve data. I also learnt a bit more about scope within javascript and how important it is.

#### For the future
I would like to make the whole thing a bit more responsive to smaller screen sizes, as it stands currently past a certain point elements become squashed together and not very nice to look at.
I would also like to address an issue i found but couldn't figure out; the criteria for the project described only searching a city, not a city and a country code - which is what i've done here. So if i were to come back to this piece of work i'd like to figure out how to utilise just the city name to get the correct results based on the user's location.
